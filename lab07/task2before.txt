The C# language's exception handling features help you deal with any unexpected or exceptional situations that occur when a program is running. 
Exception handling uses the try, catch, and finally keywords to try actions that may not succeed, to handle failures when you decide that it's reasonable 
to do so, and to clean up resources afterward. Exceptions can be generated 
by the common language runtime (CLR), by .NET or third-party libraries, or by application code. Exceptions are created by using the throw keyword
